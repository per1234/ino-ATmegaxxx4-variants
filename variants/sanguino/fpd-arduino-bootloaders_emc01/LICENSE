Licensing

    mega1284duino is licensed GPL v2.
    Optiboot is licensed GPL v2.
    Arduino is licensed GPL v2. Arduino uses the GNU avr-gcc toolchain, avrdude, avr-libc, and code from Processing and Wiring.
    The changes that I've made to this repo for FirePick Delta usage are therefore GPL v2, however, other parts of the FirePick Delta project are licensed under other open-source terms.
